# Cats_Dogs_Classifier_color
The  classification model here is more inclined towards training a model with colored images & more destined towards handling the issue of overfitting.
Overfitting is when the model starts learning the data provided for training. This way it gives good results over the training dataset but when the model is provided with an unseen dataset, it's accuracy decreases considerably. This is called overfitting.

# Coloured Images:
It's different to handle normal grayscale images than coloured images. Coloured images have more complex representational architecture and hence can not be solved by the same means as a grayscale image.
for coloured images, we cannot use 2D matrix to represent the pixel values. instead it is represented by a 3D matrix which has an additional dimension having 3 layers, with each layer representing 3 color brackets of RGB-color compounds.
