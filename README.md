# Cats_Dogs_Classifier_color
The  classification model here is more inclined towards training a model with colored images & more destined towards handling the issue of overfitting.
Overfitting is when the model starts learning the data provided for training. This way it gives good results over the training dataset but when the model is provided with an unseen dataset, it's accuracy decreases considerably. This is called overfitting.
